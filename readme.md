Description
===========


- Each piece/element has 4 square blocks
- a random sequence of pieces falls down
- we can rotate it (90 degrees each time, both ways)
- need to create a horizontal line to clear the line
- when a certain number of lines is cleared, we change the level of the game, which increases the speed of the falling pieces
- game ends when a piece reaches the top
